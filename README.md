# ACLPKotlin
ACLP is currently an open source Android application written in Kotlin and is supported by many students at OSU and other universities.

# What is it?
ACLP allows users to say to predefined short statements to automatically generate equivalent code in written in the users selected choice of language.
ACLP heavily relies on built-in SpeechRecognizer library to do speech to text operations.

# Future Goals and Motivation
The purpose and goal of ACLP is to help anyone learn the fundamentals of computer science.

# How to use?
ACLP is very simple to use, there are very few components to avoid cluster. The user can begin by clicking the round speaker icon button once
and say the desired command. Retapping the speaker button ends that specific session and the user can review their command on the textfield above that button,
the user has the option to alter the command as needed and then tapping on enter buttton will confirm that command. In any case the user needs to restart,
simply press the retry button. The last step is to press on the done button view the results.

# Screenshots
The first image is going to be where the instructions are being tokenized and are being structured using hashmap. The second image is the output.
